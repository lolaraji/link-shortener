# vanilla javascript link shortener by lola raji

Shorten links with ease!

Not only do I allow the modification of the files in this repo, but I encourage it, as while I do enjoy this shortener, it is not the best.

If you do happen to edit it, please email me the files at github@lolarajiweb.design!

I'd love to see what you can come up with!

## setup ##

I've setup the groundwork for you, however all you need to do is enter correct Firebase details. 

If you've used firebase for vanilla javascript, then you can do this all on your own, however if you haven't, I recommend this tutorial on YouTube: https://youtu.be/oxqVnWPg0So

I'll try as much as I can to update the Firebase script source however if in the event that I do not, please enter it yourself.

## how to use ##

The shortener is quite easy to use. Simply enter the URL you'd like to shorten, copy the shortened URL, and paste it into any given web browser.

It's very similar to bit.ly.

## how it was made ##

Using URL parameters, I was able to make a URL shortener.

If I had made this using NodeJS, though it would've taken much longer and would be in much higher quality.

You can of course choose to do that, but I chose to do this. 

It minimizes the amount of pages needed and is very simple to understand by the average Web Developer.

## troubleshooting ##

Problem: The page won't load!
Solution: This is usually due to your internet connectivity. Try restarting your motem or router and reload the page.

Problem: I can't get my previously generated link!
Solution: This is because due to an overflow of generations, I must clear the database daily.

## faq ##

Question: Can I use this for my work projects?
Answer: Of course! While you don't need to give me credit, I do expect for you not to claim that it is yours.

Question: Can I change the link of the shortener?
Answer: Once again, of course! Just remember to check through both of the javascript files.

Question: Why didn't you use NodeJS?
Answer: I wanted to be creative and use something other than what would traditionally be used.
