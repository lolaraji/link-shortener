# vanilla javascript link shortener by Lola Raji

Shorten links with ease!

Not only do I allow the modification of the files in this repo, but I encourage it, as while I do enjoy this shortener, it is not the best.

If you do happen to edit it, please email me the files at github@lolarajiweb.design!

I'd love to see what you can come up with!

## setup ##

I've setup the groundwork for you, however all you need to do is enter correct Firebase details. 

If you've used firebase for vanilla javascript, then you can do this all on your own, however if you haven't, I recommend this tutorial on YouTube: https://youtu.be/oxqVnWPg0So

I'll try as much as I can to update the Firebase script source however if in the event that I do not, please enter it yourself.

## how to use ##

The shortener is quite easy to use. Simply enter the URL you'd like to shorten, copy the shortened URL, and paste it into any given web browser.

It's very similar to bit.ly.
